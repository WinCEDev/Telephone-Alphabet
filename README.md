# Telephone Alphabet
This is a simple utility to quickly convert between regular words and their phonetic form. It is useful for reliably relaying information over the phone, such as website addresses, usernames and passwords.

## Getting Started
When you open the application, the main interface will appear. You can enter text to be converted in the upper text field. You can use the toolbar to quickly copy, paste or undo.

## Saving a Text File
You can export your typed text and their phonetic form to a text file for later reference or for further processing with other applications. To do this, tap _File_ and then _Save As..._, or select the disk icon on the toolbar.

## Personalizing the Application
You have various options to make the application better fit your needs.

###  Changing the Layout
You can show the input and output fields either horizontally or vertically. To change it, use the layout buttons on the toolbar or alternatively tap _View_ and choose either _Arrange Horizontally_ or _Arrange Vertically_.

### Setting the Font
You can specify an alternate font and size. To do this, select _Edit_ and then _Font_ to configure these options.

### Zooming In And Out
To zoom in and out without changing the stored text size, press _Ctrl+Plus_ and _Ctrl+Minus_, or alternatively use the menu at _View_, _Zoom_, _Zoom In_ and _Zoom Out_. Here you can also reset the zoom level back to default.
